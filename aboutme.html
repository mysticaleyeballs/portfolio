Melinda Zou
Melinda is a soon-to-be junior who is enjoying her summer. She's extremely interested in keeping up to date on current events, and the inner workings of public policy, as well as learning new languages (whether that be Korean or coding). She's currently looking in awe at her peers, wondering how they have their lives sorted out while she can barely decide what to eat for dinner. Melinda also feels extremely weird writing about herself in the third person. While she isn't attending a JSA (Junior Statesman of America) conference, she is playing tennis, working at Chick Fil A, and pondering what to do with her life. Melinda is ready to learn about anything (especially anything related to philosophy) and everything as long as it isn't Chemistry.
