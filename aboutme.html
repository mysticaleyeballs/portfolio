    <h1>About Me(l)inda</h1>
   <p> <img src="swagetyswagswag.jpg" alt=me playing tennis width="128" height="128" > </p>
    <p> My friends call me Mel but you can call me Melinda...just kidding y'all can call me Mel. I'm so happy that I was on Facebook in January and I happened to scroll past an ad for Girls Who Code. I enjoy attending JSA (Junior Statespeople of America) conferences as well as organizing mini JSA debates at my school. I love to get new experiences and stepping out of my comfort zone! Because of that, I was really excited to do the GWC Summer program because this would be more first experiences with a STEM activity. During my summer free time, I work at Chick Fil A and unfortunately have gotten into the habit of saying "my pleasure" whenever someone thanks me (thanks Chick Fil A). </p>
    <h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
      <p>I love pasta with white sauce. Any pasta with the white sauce and I promise I'll devour it. Whenever I'd try to eat healthy for a month or even week, pasta was always my kryptonite. I love that kryptonite though.
        A major dislike I have would be those loud cars. People describe the engine sound as a "roar" or a "purr"--I don't understand why they are all cat verbs--but honestly it sounds like an animal coughing up a hairball.

    <h3>CLICKBAIT: I'm Extra</h3>
    <p> A fun fact about myself is my ability to get super into whatever I'm doing at the time. During tennis season, I dream about hitting balls, the night before the JSA conference, I'll stay up all night because I procrastinated on my speeches. My friends all think I'm extra and annoying but I guess that's why they like me!
    <h3>My Favorite Links</h3>
    <p>Yeah this is so basic of me but I love online window shopping (because I look and I don't buy), and I love watching dramas.</p>
