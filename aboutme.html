    <h1>About Melinda</h1>
    <p> My friends call me Mel, but you can call me Melinda...just kidding. I'm so happy that I was on Facebook in January and I happened to scroll past an ad for Girls Who Code. I enjoy attending JSA (Junior Statespeople of America) conferences as well as organizing mini JSA debates at my school. I love to get new experiences and stepping out of my comfort zone! Because of that, I was really excited to do the GWC Summer program because this would be more first experiences with a STEM activity. During my summer free time, I work at Chick Fil A and unfortunately have gotten into the habit of saying "my pleasure" whenever someone thanks me (thanks Chick Fil A). </p>
