    <h1>About Me(l)inda</h1>
    <p> <img src="swagetyswagswag" alt="Me looking gross" style=float:left;width:140px;height:140px;">
      My friends call me Mel but you can call me Melinda...just kidding y'all can call me Mel. I'm so happy that I was on Facebook in January and I happened to scroll past an ad for Girls Who Code. I enjoy attending JSA (Junior Statespeople of America) conferences as well as organizing mini JSA debates at my school. I love to get new experiences and stepping out of my comfort zone! Because of that, I was really excited to do the GWC Summer program because this would be more first experiences with a STEM activity. During my summer free time, I work at Chick Fil A and unfortunately have gotten into the habit of saying "my pleasure" whenever someone thanks me (thanks Chick Fil A).

    <h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
      <p>I love pasta with white sauce. Any pasta with the white sauce and I promise I'll devour it. Whenever I'd try to eat healthy for a month or even week, pasta was always my kryptonite. I love that kryptonite though.
        A major dislike I have would be those loud cars. People describe the engine sound as a "roar" or a "purr"--I don't understand why they are all cat verbs--but honestly it sounds like an animal coughing up a hairball.

    <h3>CLICKBAIT: I'm Extra</h3>
    <p> A fun fact about myself is my ability to get super into whatever I'm doing at the time. During tennis season, I dream about hitting balls, the night before the JSA conference, I'll stay up all night because I procrastinated on my speeches. My friends all think I'm extra and annoying but I guess that's why they like me!
    <h3>My Favorite Links</h3>
    <p>Yeah this is so basic of me but I love online window shopping (because I look and I don't buy), and I love watching dramas.</p>

           <li><a
              Variables: Similair to variables in Math, variables in code stand for something. Variables it simpler to reference information throughout the code.</a>
           <li><a
              Functions: Functions simplify a whole list of instructions into a single line of code. Functions make it so you can just type the function instead of the multiple "equations" that come with it. </a>
           <li><a
              Loops: A loop is a programming structure that repeats a set of instructions over and over again how ever many times it's told (ex. repeat ten times, repeat forever). It is also repeated until a certain condition is met. </a> 
          <li><A
              Conditionals: They are expressions that evaluate/perform an action to true or false. For example, if this is 1, jump. If this is 2, I don't really now how to debug HAAAALP </p>

      <h3> Reflections 6/27 </h3>
      <p> Scratch and Python are both similair in the sense that you can define variables and use them within code. However, for Python it could be used for math while in Scratch, variables were used more for actions.
    You debugged today, how did that feel? What did you like? What didn’t you like?  I didn't do debugging HALPPPPP </p>
      <h3>Reflection 6/30 </h3>
      <p> A list in Python is a data structure that stores any type of data I choose (credit to the PPT).
      What is a list and how is it useful? (in your own words)
What type of group has worked well for you so far?  Why?

      <h3> Reflection 7/5 </h3>
      <p> From the discussion in class about robots, I was able to open my mind to new ways of thinking about the term "robot". I never knew that a toaster, washing machine, and even self-driving car could be classified as a robot. Taking away from the discussion in class, the future of robotics is going to be a replacement of jobs. More accuratly, automation will happen. Some might be scared of this future and might even try to prevent it from happening, but it's the future nonetheless. I think my group today worked pretty well. I liked how there were some people that gave everyone a chance to try it out. </p>
      <h3> Reflection 7/6 </h3>
      <p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work in the field of robotics and are specifically focused towards Artificial Intelligence. Our team worked very well with the light show, all the members were super helpful to each other and made sure to explain something every step of the way. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch consits of the comment in the beginning, identifying variables (like which pin to use), a function to tell where the output is from, The pinMode() function configures a pin as either an input or an output, the digitalWrite() functions outputs a value on a pin, and the delay() causes the Arduino to wait for the specified number of milliseconds before continuing on to the next line. </p>
      <h3> Reflection 7/7 </h3>
      <p> I didn't know that there were physical servers where the router would go to get the information. LaTeX is a language that allows people to format documents, and is frequently used to write academic Math and CS texts. I think LaTex is a markup language because it focuses on formatting documents rather than provide instructions for the machine/ </p>

      What have you learned about circuits that you didn’t know before?
What was your favorite part of your robot’s dance?
What kind of outputs do Manuela Veluso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots?
