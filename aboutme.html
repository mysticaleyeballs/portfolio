    <h1>About Me(l)inda</h1>
    <p> <img src="swagetyswagswag" alt="Me looking gross" style=float:left;width:140px;height:140px;">
      My friends call me Mel but you can call me Melinda...just kidding y'all can call me Mel. I'm so happy that I was on Facebook in January and I happened to scroll past an ad for Girls Who Code. I enjoy attending JSA (Junior Statespeople of America) conferences as well as organizing mini JSA debates at my school. I love to get new experiences and stepping out of my comfort zone! Because of that, I was really excited to do the GWC Summer program because this would be more first experiences with a STEM activity. During my summer free time, I work at Chick Fil A and unfortunately have gotten into the habit of saying "my pleasure" whenever someone thanks me (thanks Chick Fil A).

    <h2>Likes and Dislikes</h2>
      <p>I love pasta with white sauce. Any pasta with the white sauce and I promise I'll devour it. Whenever I'd try to eat healthy for a month or even week, pasta was always my kryptonite. I love that kryptonite though.
        A major dislike I have would be those loud cars. People describe the engine sound as a "roar" or a "purr"--I don't understand why they are all cat verbs--but honestly it sounds like an animal coughing up a hairball.

    <h3>CLICKBAIT: I'm Extra</h3>
    <p> A fun fact about myself is my ability to get super into whatever I'm doing at the time. During tennis season, I dream about hitting balls, the night before the JSA conference, I'll stay up all night because I procrastinated on my speeches. My friends all think I'm extra and annoying but I guess that's why they like me!
    <h3>My Favorite Links</h3>
    <p>Yeah this is so basic of me but I love online window shopping (because I look and I don't buy), and I love watching dramas.</p>

       <p> Techinical Definitions </p>
          <uo>
           <li><a
              Variables: Similair to variables in Math, variables in code stand for something. Variables it simpler to reference information throughout the code.</a>
           <li><a
              Functions: Functions simplify a whole list of instructions into a single line of code. Functions make it so you can just type the function instead of the multiple "equations" that come with it. </a>
           <li><a
              Loops: A loop is a programming structure that repeats a set of instructions over and over again how ever many times it's told (ex. repeat ten times, repeat forever). It is also repeated until a certain condition is met. </a> 
          <li><A
              Conditionals: They are expressions that evaluate/perform an action to true or false. For example, if this is 1, jump. If this is 2, crouch. </a>
